<p>We’re excited that you’ve chosen to develop on the LinkedIn platform.
 At LinkedIn, we believe in putting our members first. We created our 
developer program to enable developers to create fantastic applications 
for our members. Together, we are building the professional web.</p>
<p>Note: You are entering into a legally binding agreement.</p>
</div>
<div class="content">
<p>Last revised on June 18, 2014.</p>
<h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<p>About us and these API Terms of Use</p>
<p>You agree that by using our developer platform, you are entering into
 a legally binding agreement with LinkedIn Corporation, 2029 Stierlin 
Court, Mountain View, California 94043, USA and LinkedIn Ireland 
Limited, Gardner House, Wilton Plaza, Wilton Place, Dublin 2, Ireland (“<strong>we</strong>,” “<strong>us</strong>,” “<strong>our</strong>,” and “<strong>LinkedIn</strong>”). By registering for an account (a “<strong>Developer Account</strong>”) at the LinkedIn Developer Network site at developer.linkedin.com (the “<strong>Developer Site</strong>”), you acknowledge that you have read and understood and agree to be bound by these LinkedIn API Terms of Use (the “<strong>Terms</strong>”).
 If you are using our developer platform on behalf of a company or other
 entity, you represent and warrant that you have full legal authority to
 register for a Developer Account on behalf of that entity and bind it 
to these Terms. If you are not authorized, you may not accept the Terms 
or register for a Developer Account for someone else.</p>
<p>These Terms will evolve, so please check back regularly. It is your responsibility to remain informed of these Terms.</p>
<div class="left">
<ol class="upperABC"><li>Purpose
<p>The mission of LinkedIn is to connect the world’s professionals to 
enable them to be more productive and successful. To achieve our 
mission, we make APIs available to third party developers such as you to
 create applications for our members and customers.</p>
</li>
<li>Scope and Intent
<p>The LinkedIn Developer Program includes a self-service platform 
program, where you can develop applications using LinkedIn’s APIs as 
soon as you register for a Developer Account and agree to follow these 
Terms, and a “Platform Partner Program,” where you can apply to develop 
applications if they meet our Platform Partner Program eligibility 
criteria and you have entered into a signed partnership agreement with 
LinkedIn.</p>
<p>As used in these Terms, “<strong>APIs</strong>” means programmatic web APIs and associated tools and documentation that LinkedIn provides, and “<strong>Application</strong>” means a software application, website, or product you create or a service you offer.</p>
<p>Here are the guidelines to determine which of LinkedIn’s developer programs fits your Application:</p>
<ol><li>Self-Service Program
<p>You may use our self-service program if you are developing an 
Application designed to help LinkedIn members be more productive and 
successful across the web; for example, by augmenting their profile and 
professional brand in an Application for publishing, discussing and 
sharing content with like-minded professionals and by applying for a job
 on a company’s career site.</p>
<p>You cannot use our self-service program and must talk to us directly,
 as you may be subject to additional Terms, if your Application:</p>
<p></p><ul><li>is expected to:
<ul><li>have more than 250,000 lifetime members; or</li>
<li>make more than 500,000 daily calls to a LinkedIn API; or</li>
<li>make more than 500,000 lifetime people search calls to a LinkedIn API; or</li>
<li>serve greater than 1 million daily plug-in impressions; or</li>
</ul></li>
<li>relies on access to APIs as a fundamental aspect of your business.</li>
<li>will store or export any data from LinkedIn other than a LinkedIn 
member’s profile data (name, photo, headline, contact information, 
experience, education, summary, and location). This includes data for 
anyone other than the member who requested the data, such as profile or 
other data about the member’s connections; network updates; search 
results generated using LinkedIn data; and information about companies 
and job postings.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Partner Program
<p>You must apply to our Platform Partner Program and cannot use our 
self-service program if your Application targets current or potential 
paying customers of LinkedIn products or people engaging in activities 
related to those products—in other words, Applications used for hiring, 
marketing, or selling.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of what we mean by hiring, marketing and selling:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Hiring</strong>: Applications to find a job or fill a 
job, such as ones used to advertise, post, apply for, search for, 
recommend, refer, suggest, enhance listings for, or fill permanent jobs,
 contract positions, or volunteer opportunities, or for anything with a 
similar functionality. (You can however use our self-service program for
 building an Application to let people apply for a job on a company’s 
career site, as long as it abides by the specification at <a href="https://developer.linkedin.com/apply-with-linkedin">https://developer.linkedin.com/apply-with-linkedin</a>.)</li>
<li><strong>Marketing</strong>: Applications used by marketers or their 
customers for marketing campaigns, lead generation, campaign analysis, 
or for anything with similar functionality. (You can however use our 
self-service program for building an Application to let companies manage
 their social media presence on LinkedIn, as long as it abides by 
Section 3.B.5. below (“Social Media Management: Company Profile and 
Statistics Data”).)</li>
<li><strong>Selling</strong>: Applications used by sales or other 
outbound professionals for generating or finding prospects or leads, for
 sales intelligence or training, for relationship management, for 
systematic matching of individuals with their LinkedIn profiles, or for 
anything with similar functionality.</li>
</ul><p>For more information about the Platform Partner Program 
application process, eligibility criteria and the areas where we are 
looking for partners visit <a href="https://developer.linkedin.com/partner-programs">https://developer.linkedin.com/partner-programs</a>.</p>
</li>
</ol></li>
</ol></div>
<h2>2. Joining our Self-Service Program</h2>
<ol class="upperABC"><li>Developer Accounts and Access Credentials
<p>
</p><ol><li>Developer Account
<p>To use our self-service APIs, you must first sign up for a Developer 
Account using your real LinkedIn member account. Both the Developer 
Account and your LinkedIn member account must contain accurate and 
up-to-date information at all times, including your current title, 
company, and e-mail address. You agree that we can use, store, and share
 information submitted by you through your Developer Account as 
permitted in our Privacy Policy.</p>
</li>
<li>Access Credentials
<p>Once you have a Developer Account you may obtain Access Credentials for your Application. “<strong>Access Credentials</strong>”
 means the necessary security keys, secrets, tokens, passwords, and 
other credentials to access the APIs. The Access Credentials enable us 
to associate your API activity with your Application and the members 
using it. All activities that occur using your Access Credentials are 
your responsibility. Keep them secret. Do not sell, transfer, or 
sublicense them. Do not try to circumvent them. And do not require your 
users to obtain their own Access Credentials to use your Application.</p>
</li>
<li>Test Account
<p>You may create up to five LinkedIn test accounts for testing purposes
 only. You must create the accounts manually and not via any automated 
means, such as scripts. These test accounts must not interact with 
non-test accounts (for example, you can’t use test accounts to post 
messages in Groups), or override our API user limits. You must clearly 
identify the accounts as test accounts in the applicable account 
profile, and must identify these additional account profiles as 
“Developers” in your Developer Account. You may not create any profile 
positions at real companies (besides your own) through the test 
accounts.</p>
</li>
<li>API License
<p>As long as you follow these Terms, we grant you a limited, 
non-exclusive, non-assignable, non-transferable license under LinkedIn’s
 intellectual property rights to use the APIs to develop, test, and 
support your Application, and to let your customers use your integration
 of the APIs within your Application.</p>
</li>
<li>Plugins
<p>The use of our plugins is subject to the terms of our Plugins Terms 
of Use. If you use both APIs and LinkedIn plugins in your Application, 
you must comply with both these Terms and the Plugins Terms of Use.</p>
</li>
</ol></li>
</ol><h2>3. Act Professionally</h2>
<ol class="upperABC"><li>Display and Use Content Properly
<p>
</p><ol><li>Data Views
<p>People’s views of their LinkedIn networks are private to them, based 
on the connections they have. Each user must give you express permission
 to access their LinkedIn account and network through your Application, 
and you must provide the user’s account and network information only to 
that user and no one else. In addition, your Application must not permit
 users to share their networks or data about their networks to anyone 
else.</p>
</li>
<li>Excluded Uses
<p>You must never do any of the following under these Terms:</p>
<ol class="lowerabc"><li>Use LinkedIn Content in any advertisements or for purposes of targeting advertisements, in your Application or elsewhere. “<strong>Content</strong>” means any data or content from our Website or accessed via the APIs. Our “<strong>Website</strong>” means LinkedIn’s website at www.linkedin.com and any other website owned or operated by LinkedIn.</li>
<li>Use the Content for any of the following: generating messages, 
promotions, offers, or mass messages; or for any other purpose other 
than to allow end users to use the Content in your Application. This 
includes using the Content to send a mass message to users asking them 
to interact with each other, such as to rate each other.</li>
<li>Use the APIs in any Application that includes adult content, 
promotes gambling, involves the sale of tobacco or alcohol to persons 
under 21 years of age, or otherwise violates any law or regulation.</li>
<li>Sell, lease, share, transfer, or sublicense any Content or access to
 any Content, directly or indirectly, to anybody. That includes data 
brokers, salespeople, advertisers, social or professional networks, 
recruiters, or anyone besides yourself or the company on whose behalf 
you agreed to these Terms.</li>
<li>Use the APIs to retrieve Content mingled with third party search results (i.e., aggregated search results).</li>
<li>Commingle or supplement Content from the APIs with any other 
LinkedIn data. For example, you cannot supplement the data you have 
received via a LinkedIn API with data scraped from our Website (whether 
that scraping was done by you or someone else) or from any other source.
 &nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Use someone’s Access Credentials to show his or her Content to 
someone else, e.g., as part of search results. Each user must 
authenticate individually to retrieve his or her Content through the 
APIs. &nbsp;</li>
<li>Distribute or allow access to the stand-alone APIs to anyone other 
than the company on whose behalf you agreed to these Terms, or create an
 API that enables access to LinkedIn Content. Anyone who wants to access
 our APIs and Content must register for our Developer Program.</li>
</ol></li>
</ol></li><li>Store Content Only As Allowed
<p>
</p><ol><li>No Storing Any Content
<p>You must not copy or store any Content or capture or store any 
information expressed by the Content (such as hashed or transformed 
data), except to the extent permitted by these Terms.</p>
</li>
<li>You May Store Tokens
<p>You may store the alphanumeric user IDs (Member Tokens) that we 
provide to you for identifying users or any individual member’s 
authentication token (OAuth Token) that we provide to you when a 
LinkedIn user authenticates your Application to his LinkedIn account.</p>
</li>
<li>Cache for Performance
<p>To improve the member experience, you may cache the Content for up to
 24 hours from a request for that Content through the API. This limited 
permission to cache is for performance reasons only. You do not have any
 rights to store the LinkedIn Content beyond this limited 24-hour 
period.</p>
</li>
<li>Member Profile Data
<p>You may store a user’s Profile Data if you have the consent of the 
user to do so, for example, so that a user applying for a job at your 
company can provide you with a copy of their profile. “Profile Data” 
means the name, photo, headline, contact information, experience, 
education, summary, and location of a LinkedIn member. Profile Data 
excludes connections, network updates, job listings, groups, companies, 
and any other Content. The process for obtaining member consent must 
meet our specifications set forth at <a href="https://developer.linkedin.com/documents/specifications-obtaining-consent-store-profile-data">https://developer.linkedin.com/documents/specifications-obtaining-consent-store-profile-data</a>.
 If you want to refresh the user’s Profile Data, you may only do so when
 the user is actually using your application and not on an automated 
schedule. You must use stored Profile Data solely for the benefit of the
 LinkedIn user that granted you permission to access it, for example, to
 evaluate that user for a position in your company. You must not 
monetize it, directly or indirectly. For example, you may not sell or 
otherwise provide access to an aggregated collection of profiles or the 
most relevant people for a position.</p>
</li>
<li>Social Media Management: Company Profile and Statistics Data
<p>You may store company page status updates, analytics on company page 
status updates, company follower analytics data, and text content of 
comments on company status updates received via the Company Share API (“<strong>Company Profile and Statistics Data</strong>”)
 on behalf of your company. Company Profile and Statistics Data excludes
 any personal information tied to users who posted comments on any 
company page. You must not commingle the Company Profile and Statistics 
Data with any of your data or with data belonging to any third party.</p>
<p>In addition, as long as you let your clients know that you are 
storing Company Profile Statistics Data for them, you may store Company 
Profile and Statistics Data for them. However, as soon as your client 
stops receiving LinkedIn Content through your Application, you must 
permanently delete the client’s Company Profile and Statistics Data in 
10 days or less. Upon termination of these Terms for any reason, you 
must permanently delete all Company Profile and Statistics Data for all 
clients.</p>
</li>
<li>Protection of Stored Data
<p>You must use commercially reasonable security measures to protect the
 confidentiality of all stored data, which measures are at least as 
secure as those you use to protect your own confidential information. 
The stored data must not be transferred or provided to any third 
parties. LinkedIn may require that you certify that you have deleted 
stored data.</p>
</li>
</ol></li><li>Delete Content When Asked
<p>
</p><ol><li>Delete at User Request
<p>You must delete all data collected with the user’s consent, including
 the Member Token and the OAuth Token, upon request by the user, when 
the user uninstalls your Application, or when the user closes his or her
 account with you. The restrictions of this Section 3.C.1 do not apply 
to data that users provide directly to you and that is separately 
entered or uploaded to you by the user of your Application. You must 
delete all Company Profile and Statistics Data collected with your 
client's consent within 10 days of receiving a request from your client.</p>
</li>
<li>Delete for Breach
<p>You must immediately delete all data if we terminate your use of the 
APIs for breach of these Terms, except when doing so would cause you to 
violate any law or obligation imposed by a governmental authority.</p>
</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Don’t Harm or Trick Members
<p>
</p><ol><li>
<p>Your Application must include your own user agreement and privacy 
policy. Your user agreement and privacy policy must be prominently 
identified or located where users download or access your Application. 
You must promptly notify us of any breaches of your user agreement or 
privacy policy that impact or may impact our members. Your privacy 
policy must be at least as stringent and user-friendly as LinkedIn’s.</p>
<p>Before obtaining information from your users of the Application, you 
must obtain their informed consent by informing them what information 
you collect and how it will be used and/or shared.</p>
<p>Your Application must not:</p>
<ul><li>Implement features or business practices that harm the 
professional reputation, relationships, or professional ecosystem of 
LinkedIn members.</li>
<li>Impersonate a LinkedIn user or misrepresent any user or other third party when requesting or publishing information.</li>
<li>Obfuscate or hide any LinkedIn buttons, sign-in functionality, 
consent, or authorization flows from your users. In order to access 
member-specific Content through the APIs, your users must sign-in with 
their LinkedIn credentials and grant your Application access to their 
Content.</li>
<li>Proxy, request, or use LinkedIn user names or passwords in any 
fashion for any reason. We want our members to have safe and consistent 
experiences across all Applications.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
<li>Be a Good Citizen to our Platform
<p>
</p><ol><li>
<p>When you use the LinkedIn APIs, you share LinkedIn with your fellow 
LinkedIn members and developers. Write your Application as you’d want 
others to write theirs.</p>
<ul><li>Only ask for the minimum data fields your Application needs.</li>
<li>Don’t try to exceed or circumvent your limitations on calls and use.
 This includes creating multiple Applications for identical, or largely 
similar, usage (e.g., having one Application per customer). If we 
believe that you have exceeded or circumvented our limitations, or if 
you have tried to, we may temporarily suspend or permanently block your 
access to the APIs, disable your developer account, or both.</li>
<li>Don’t download, scrape, post, or transmit, in any form or by any 
means, any part of our Website. This includes data retrieved by web 
browser plugins.</li>
<li>Don’t copy, reformat, reverse-engineer, or otherwise modify the APIs, Access Credentials, our Website or any Content.</li>
<li>Don’t interfere with or disrupt LinkedIn services or servers or 
networks connected to LinkedIn services, or disobey any requirements, 
procedures, policies or regulations of networks connected to LinkedIn 
services.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
<li>Treat Our Brand With Respect
<p>
</p><ol><li>Brand Features License
<p>Subject to these Terms, including the <a href="https://developer.linkedin.com/documents/branding-guidelines">Branding Guidelines</a>,
 we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-assignable, 
non-sublicenseable, and non-transferable license during the Term to 
display our Brand Features to promote or advertise your integration of 
the APIs in your Application. “<strong>Brand Features</strong>” means any trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos and domain names that LinkedIn makes available to you.</p>
</li>
<li>Restrictions.
<p>You must not:</p>
<ol><li>Display our Brand Features in any way that is misleading, 
defamatory, infringing, libelous, disparaging, obscene, or otherwise 
objectionable to LinkedIn in its sole discretion, or in a way that 
suggests we have created, sponsored, or endorsed your Application or its
 content;</li>
<li>Remove any legal, copyright, trademark, watermark or other 
proprietary rights notices contained in or on materials you receive or 
access pursuant to these Terms, including the APIs, the materials posted
 at the Developer Site, and our Website; or</li>
<li>Use the APIs or Brand Features for any illegal, unauthorized or 
otherwise improper purposes, or in any manner that would violate these 
Terms (or any document incorporated into the Terms), or breach any laws 
or regulations, or violate any rights of third parties, or expose 
LinkedIn or its members to legal liability in your use of the APIs.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Publicity by You
<p>Subject to our Branding Guidelines, you may promote your Application,
 including talking to traditional and online media and your users about 
your Application, so long as you do so truthfully and without implying 
that your Application is created or endorsed by LinkedIn (or otherwise 
embellishing your relationship with LinkedIn). However, you may not 
issue any formal press release via traditional or online media referring
 to LinkedIn without LinkedIn’s prior consent, unless expressly allowed 
in the Branding Guidelines.</p>
</li>
<li>Publicity by Us
<p>We may publicly refer to you, orally or in writing, as a licensee of 
the LinkedIn APIs. We may also publish your name and logo (with or 
without a link to your Application) on our Website, in press releases, 
and in promotional materials without your prior consent.</p>
</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Follow The Law and These Terms
<p>You must comply with all applicable laws, including, the Digital 
Millennium Copyright Act and applicable export laws, and these Terms, 
which may be amended from time to time with or without advance notice, 
in order to use the LinkedIn APIs. You and your Application must also 
comply with the following, which are hereby incorporated by reference:</p>
<ul><li><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/static?key=user_agreement&amp;trk=hb_ft_userag">The LinkedIn User Agreement</a>;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.linkedin.com/static?key=privacy_policy&amp;trk=hb_ft_priv">The LinkedIn Privacy Policy</a>;</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.linkedin.com/documents/linkedin-platform-guidelines">The Platform Guidelines, which are located at the Developer Site</a>; and</li>
<li><a href="https://developer.linkedin.com/documents/branding-guidelines">The Branding Guidelines</a>.</li>
</ul><p>In the event of any conflict between the content in this 
document and the above documents, this document controls your use of the
 APIs. If you disagree with any of the provisions in these Terms, do not
 access or use the APIs.</p>
<p>The most current version of these Terms can be reviewed on the 
Developer Site. By using the LinkedIn APIs after changes are made to the
 Terms, you agree to be bound by the most current version. If you 
disagree with the Terms, or changes to the Terms, you must discontinue 
your use of the APIs.</p>
<p>If we have entered into a separate, written API License Agreement 
with you, the terms of that agreement will govern your use of those 
APIs.</p>
</li>
</ol><h2>4. Safety and Abuse</h2>
<ol class="upperABC"><li>Security Measures
<p>Your network, operating system and the software of your web servers, 
databases, and computer systems (collectively, “Systems”) must be 
properly configured to securely operate your Application. You must not 
architect or select Systems in a manner to avoid the foregoing 
obligation. You must promptly report any security deficiencies in or 
intrusions to your Systems that you discover to LinkedIn in writing via 
email to security@linkedin.com or subsequent contact information posted 
in the Developer Site. You will work with LinkedIn to immediately 
correct any security deficiency, and will disconnect immediately any 
intrusions or intruder. In the event of any security deficiency or 
intrusion involving the Application, you will make no public statements 
(e.g. press, blogs, social media, bulletin boards, etc.) without prior 
written and express permission from LinkedIn in each instance.</p>
</li>
<li> Monitoring
<p>You agree to assist LinkedIn in verifying your compliance with these 
Terms by providing information about your Application to us, which may 
also include access to your Application and other materials related to 
your use of the APIs. If you do not demonstrate full compliance with 
these Terms, we may restrict or terminate your access to the APIs.</p>
</li>
</ol><h2>5. Rights We Reserve</h2>
<ol class="upperABC"><li>Support and Modifications
<p>We may provide you with support or modifications for the APIs in our 
sole discretion. We may stop providing support or modifications to you 
at any time without notice or liability to you. We may release 
subsequent versions of the APIs and require that you use those 
subsequent versions. Your continued use of the APIs following a 
subsequent release will be deemed your acceptance of modifications.</p>
</li>
<li>Fees
<p>The APIs are currently provided for free, but LinkedIn reserves the 
right to charge for the APIs in the future. If we do charge a fee for 
use of the APIs or any developer tools and features, you do not have any
 obligation to continue to use LinkedIn’s developer resources.</p>
</li>
<li>LinkedIn Independent Development
<p>You understand and acknowledge that LinkedIn may be independently 
creating applications, content, and other products or services that may 
be similar to or competitive with your Application. Nothing in these 
Terms will be construed as restricting or preventing LinkedIn from 
creating and fully exploiting any applications, content, and other 
items, without any obligation to you.</p>
</li>
<li>Developer Exception to our Privacy Policy
<p>LinkedIn may reveal personal information about developers for 
attribution purposes, handling inquiries from users or potential users, 
and other purposes LinkedIn reasonably deems necessary under these 
Terms. You understand and agree that LinkedIn may access, preserve, and 
disclose your personal information and your developer account details if
 required to do so by law or in a good faith belief that such access, 
preservation, or disclosure is reasonably necessary to comply with legal
 process or to protect the rights, property, or safety of LinkedIn, its 
affiliates or partners, its users, or the general public.</p>
</li>
</ol><h2>6. Ownership</h2>
<ol class="upperABC"><li>LinkedIn Property
<p>As between you and us, we own all rights, title, and interest, 
including all intellectual property rights, in and to, the (a) APIs, and
 all elements, components, and executables of the APIs; (b) the Content 
available through the APIs; (c) our Website; and (d) our Brand Features 
(clauses (a)-(d) collectively, the “LinkedIn Materials”). Except for the
 express licenses granted in these Terms, LinkedIn does not grant you 
any right, title, or interest in the LinkedIn Materials. You agree to 
take such actions, including executing affidavits or other documents, as
 LinkedIn may reasonably request to effect, perfect, or confirm 
LinkedIn’s rights to the LinkedIn Materials.</p>
</li>
<li>Your Property
<p>
</p><ol><li>
						Contributions to LinkedIn
<p>By submitting suggestions or other feedback regarding the LinkedIn 
Materials ("Contributions") in any way to LinkedIn, you acknowledge and 
agree that: (a) your Contributions do not contain confidential or 
proprietary information; (b) LinkedIn is not under any obligation of 
confidentiality, express or implied, with respect to the Contributions; 
(c) LinkedIn shall be entitled to use or disclose (or choose not to use 
or disclose) such Contributions for any purpose, in any way, in any 
media worldwide; (d) LinkedIn may have something similar to the 
Contributions already under consideration or in development; (e) you 
irrevocably non-exclusively license to LinkedIn rights to exploit your 
Contributions; and (f) you are not entitled to any compensation or 
reimbursement of any kind from LinkedIn under any circumstances.</p>
</li>
<li>
						Your Application
<p>You represent and warrant to LinkedIn that, excluding LinkedIn 
Materials, you have the right to use, reproduce, transmit, copy, 
publicly display, publicly perform, and distribute your Application, and
 that use by LinkedIn and its users of your Application will not violate
 the rights of any third party (e.g., copyright, patent, trademark, or 
other proprietary right of any person or entity), or any applicable 
regulation or law, including the laws of any country in which your 
Application is made available. Except to the extent your Application 
contains LinkedIn Materials, LinkedIn claims no ownership or control 
over your Application. During the term of these Terms you hereby grant

<h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
<p>SOME COUNTRIES DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY 
IN CONTRACTS WITH CONSUMERS AND AS A RESULT THE CONTENTS OF THIS SECTION
 MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. Neither LinkedIn nor any of our subsidiaries, 
affiliated companies, suppliers, employees, shareholders, or directors 
(“LinkedIn Affiliates”) shall be cumulatively liable for any special, 
incidental, indirect, punitive or consequential damages or loss of use, 
profit, revenue or data to you or any third person arising from your use
 of LinkedIn materials accessed through or downloaded from LinkedIn. 
This limitation of liability shall:</p>
<ul><li>Apply regardless of whether (1) you base your claim on contract,
 tort, statute or any other legal theory, (2) we knew or should have 
known about the possibility of such damages, or (3) the limited remedies
 provided in this section fail of their essential purpose; and</li>
<li>Not apply to any damage that LinkedIn may cause you intentionally or
 knowingly in violation of these Terms or applicable law, or as 
otherwise mandated by applicable law that cannot be disclaimed in these 
Terms.</li>
<li>Not apply if you have entered into a separate agreement to license a
 LinkedIn API(s) with a separate Limitation of Liability provision that 
supersedes this section in relation to that particular LinkedIn API(s).</li>
</ul><h2>10. Dispute Resolution</h2>
<ol class="upperABC"><li>Law and Forum for Legal Disputes
<p>These Terms and any claim, cause of action or dispute (“claim”) 
arising out of or related to these Terms shall be governed by the laws 
of the state of California, United States, regardless of your country of
 origin or where you access LinkedIn, and notwithstanding of any 
conflicts of law principles and the United Nations Convention for the 
International Sale of Goods. You and LinkedIn agree that all claims 
arising out of or related to these Terms must be resolved exclusively by
 a state or federal court located in Santa Clara County, California, 
except as otherwise agreed by the parties or as described in the 
Arbitration Option paragraph below. You and LinkedIn agree to submit to 
the personal jurisdiction of the courts located within Santa Clara 
County, California for the purpose of litigating all such claims. 
Notwithstanding the above, you agree that LinkedIn shall still be 
allowed to apply for injunctive remedies (or an equivalent type of 
urgent legal relief) in any jurisdiction.</p>
</li>
<li>
			Arbitration Option
<p>For any claim (excluding claims for injunctive or other equitable 
relief) where the total amount of the award sought is less than $10,000,
 the party requesting relief may elect to resolve the dispute in a cost 
effective manner through binding non-appearance-based arbitration. In 
the event a party elects arbitration, they shall initiate such 
arbitration through an established alternative dispute resolution 
(“ADR”) provider mutually agreed upon by the parties. The ADR provider 
and the parties must comply with the following rules: (a) the 
arbitration shall be conducted by telephone, online and/or be solely 
based on written submissions, the specific manner shall be chosen by the
 party initiating the arbitration; (b) the arbitration shall not involve
 any personal appearance by the parties or witnesses unless otherwise 
mutually agreed by the parties; and (c) any judgment on the award 
rendered by the arbitrator shall be final and may be entered in any 
court of competent jurisdiction.</p>
</li>
</ol><h2>11. General Terms</h2>
<p>Here are some important details about how to read these Terms.</p>
<ol class="upperABC"><li>Severability
<p>If any provision of these Terms is found by a court of competent 
jurisdiction or arbitrator to be illegal, void, or unenforceable, the 
unenforceable provision will be modified so as to render it enforceable 
and effective to the maximum extent possible in order to effect the 
intention of the provision; if a court or arbitrator finds the modified 
provision invalid, illegal, void or unenforceable, the validity, 
legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of these Terms 
will not be affected in any way.</p>
</li>
<li>Language
<p>Where LinkedIn has provided you with a translation of the English 
language version of these Terms, the Privacy Policy, or any other 
documentation, you agree that the translation is provided for your 
convenience only and that the English language versions of these Terms, 
the Privacy Policy, and any other documentation, including additional 
terms of service for Premium Services, will govern your relationship 
with LinkedIn.</p>
</li>
<li>Notices and Service of Process
<p>In addition to Section 11.C. (“Notices and Service Messages”), we may
 notify you via postings on Developer Site. You may contact us here. Or 
via mail or courier at: LinkedIn Corporation ATTN: Legal Department 2029
 Stierlin Court Mountain View, CA 94043 USA. &nbsp;Additionally, 
LinkedIn accepts service of process at this address. Any notices that 
you provide without compliance with this section shall have no legal 
effect.</p>
</li>
<li> Entire Agreement
<p>You agree that these Terms constitutes the entire, complete and 
exclusive agreement between you and LinkedIn regarding the LinkedIn APIs
 and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, whether written
 or oral, or whether established by custom, practice, policy or 
precedent, with respect to the subject matter of these Terms. You also 
may be subject to additional terms and conditions that may apply when 
you use or purchase or use certain other LinkedIn services, third-party 
content or third party software.</p>
</li>
<li>Amendments to these Terms
<p>We reserve the right to modify, supplement, or replace the terms of 
these Terms, effective prospectively upon posting on the Developer Site 
or notifying you otherwise. For example, we may present a banner on the 
Developer Site when we have amended these Terms so that you may access 
and review the changes prior to your continued use of the LinkedIn APIs 
and developer platform. If you do not want to agree to changes to these 
Terms, you can terminate these Terms at any time by ceasing use of the 
APIs and/or closing your Developer Account.</p>
</li>
<li>No informal waivers, agreements or representations
<p>Our failure to act with respect to a breach of these Terms by you or 
others does not waive our right to act with respect to that breach or 
subsequent similar or other breaches. Except as expressly and 
specifically contemplated by these Terms, no representations, 
statements, consents, waivers or other acts or omissions by any LinkedIn
 affiliate shall be deemed legally binding on any LinkedIn Affiliate, 
unless documented in a physical writing hand signed by a duly appointed 
officer of LinkedIn.</p>
</li>
<li>No Injunctive Relief
<p>In no event shall you seek or be entitled to rescission, injunctive 
or other equitable relief, or to enjoin or restrain the operation of the
 LinkedIn developer platform or any APIs, content or other material used
 or displayed through the LinkedIn developer platform.</p>
</li>
<li>Beneficiaries
<p>Entities other than LinkedIn Corporation and LinkedIn Ireland, 
Limited, that LinkedIn Corporation owns a 50% or greater interest in 
(“Affiliate”) are not parties, but intended third party beneficiaries of
 these Terms, with a right to enforce these Terms directly against you.</p>
</li>
<li>Assignment and Delegation
<p>You may not assign or delegate any rights or obligations under these 
Terms. Any purported assignment and delegation shall be ineffective. We 
may freely assign or delegate all rights and obligations under these 
Terms, fully or partially without notice to you. We may also substitute,
 by way of unilateral novation, effective upon notice to you, LinkedIn 
Corporation for any third party that assumes our rights and obligations 
under these Terms.</p>
</li>
<li>Potential Other Rights and Obligations
<p>You may have rights or obligations under local law other than those 
enumerated here if you are located outside the United States.</p>
